## [0.1.0] - 2025-08-31

### Initial release

- Published TextMate scoping for Org Mode: initial production release of the Org grammar/scopes used by the extension (scopes and mappings for `syntaxes/org.tmLanguage.json` and `syntaxes/org.language-configuration.json`). This enables accurate scope-naming and improves highlighting, embedding and tooling integration.

## [Unreleased]
