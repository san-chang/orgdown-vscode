## About The Project

Welcome to Orgdown! This is a Visual Studio Code extension dedicated to bringing the legendary organizational power of [Emacs' Org Mode](https://orgmode.org/) to the modern, accessible environment of VS Code. Our mission is to faithfully implement 80% or more of the core Org Mode feature set, focusing on robust syntax highlighting, code block execution, and task management.

This project is built with a professional-grade, test-driven architecture to ensure stability and maintainability.
